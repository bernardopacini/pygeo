pyGeo
====================================================

pyGeo is an object oriented geometry manipulation framework for multidisciplinary design optimization.
It provides a free form deformation based geometry manipulation object, an interface to NASA's Vehicle Sketch Pad geometry engine, a simple geometric constraint formulation object, and some utility functions for geometry manipulation.
